# Local-Path-Plan-with-Bug1-Algorithm
  
 * The purpose of the project is to reach the target point without hitting obstacles by using one of the local planning algorithms. Bug 1 algorithm is used for this.
 * You can read this file [paper.pdf](https://github.com/suhedaras/Local-Path-Plan-with-Bug1-Algorithm/blob/main/paper.pdf) for detailed information about the project.
 * You can reach the base repo [here](https://github.com/Smashroom/Portfolio/tree/master/Robotics/Bug%20Algorithms)
 
 ## Result
   
The path followed by the algorithm is as follows.
